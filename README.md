Thumbor on OpenShift
=================

This project is a sample of how to deploy [Thumbor](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor) 
to [OpenShift Cloud](https://www.openshift.com/). Thumbor is an open-source image processing 
service created by [Globo.com](http://globo.com). In a few words, Thumbor is perfect to decouple 
your application from any image processing job (thumbnail generation, image resizing, 
image optimization, etc) and let you focus in your core problem. You can learn more about 
Thumbor project in their [wiki page](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/wiki).
